0. step into water and then visit [7,4]
0. be dry until reaching [10,8]
0. bring one green from [7,4] to [3,4]
0. take all green from [7,4] to water
0. pick two triangle from [4,0]
0. get one triangle from [4,0] and then one item from [11,1]
0. get one item from [4,0] and one from [7,4]  and in the 
process never step on a water tile:  **choking here, thinking of ways to
 improve. PROBLEM: formula size is too big and I am searching first over 
 the space of smaller formulas. ANOTHER PROBLEM: if searching through 
 bigger formulas, it finds many equivalent ones, resulting in searching 
 forever**
0. get one green and one blue item from [7,4] **at the moment, this one
 too takes too long because the formula is of depth 5 and there is not
  good enough symmetry breaking**
0. reach [5,4] by only by going through the water (environment should have enough water to make it possible
0. first get one red item from [7,4] and afterwards one green item from
 [10,8]
