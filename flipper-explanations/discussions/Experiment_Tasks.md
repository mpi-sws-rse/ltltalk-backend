# Experiment Tasks 

In our new interactive Flipper, different types of tests are going to be added with complexity of 
Beginner, Medium and difficult. List of tasks are as follow:


## Tasks

There are three different level of tasks sets ahead. Please, read all of them first to get the rough idea how they look like.

Now start solving them (if you haven't already, check the tutorial section to get you started). After finishing each set of tasks,
reset the environment (blue *RESET button*). Remember, reseting only affects front-end, all the learnt rules are preserved. 
While you can solve the tasks in the best way you see fit, there is a benefit in trying to provide a general solution 
(that would work in more than one situation) because you can reuse solutions as building blocks in the tasks that follow. 
It might also be useful to define some basic building blocks that are not tasks themselves (e.g. `pick green`for `pick item is green`).



### Level 1

reset the environment

1. 
  * Get one green square
  
  * Visit any field containing both a yellow item and a circle-shaped item (may be the same item)

  * Pick a yellow item from that space


reset the environment

2. 

  * Visit empty space (here a general definition is needed)
  
  * Get one green circle, one red triangle and one yellow square. Put those items to different empty spaces on the map

  * Visit any field containing both a triangle-shaped item and a green item (may be the same item) and pick up all the items from that field



reset the environment

3. 

  * Get one red triangle
  
  * Collect all red items

  * Put all blue items to room3



reset the environment

4. 

  * Get one red square
  
  * Move forward forward to four steps

  * Pick one green item




reset the environment

5. 

  * Go to the location [1,2]
  
  * Pick one green circle, one yellow triangle 

  * Take them at location [3,3]



### Level 2

reset the environment

1. 
  * Move 5 steps upward and pick a yellow item from that space
  
  * Visit any field containing both a circle and triangle items 

  * Pick all these item and step in water


reset the environment

2. 

  * Go to location [1,3] and pick all item from that space
  
  * Stay dry and get three red item


reset the environment

3. 

  * Get all green item
  
  * Move forward 6 steps and pick one red item

  * Then take them to any nearest water tile
